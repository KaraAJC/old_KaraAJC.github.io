                                <p>Technology lets you create some amazing things, but there are some things that have yet to be duplicated via technology. As <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/10/future-of-artificial-intelligence/">advanced as we have become with Artificial Intelligence</a>, there are still many things we just can't teach technology to do. </p>
                                <p>This week, I took some time to think about the ways we must use human intelligence to shore up what we cannot do with artificial intelligence, how this affects the industry, and what role we as developers play in that system.</p>
                                <p>Upon considering what problems the tech industry faces, a friend of mine mentioned a <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/10/content-moderation/">recent article in Wired</a>, about the labor force who works to filter out unsafe/unsanitary/unspeakable content from major social media sites. Having never thought of the specific process that currently exists for flagged content to be reviewed and removed from the internet, I was quite intrigued. As content consumers, many of us may presume that websites have ways of determining inappropriate content, using keywords, and other algorithms, but society is more nuanced than that, not something that we can easily utilize AI for. What we're left with is a disturbing level of trauma these laborers face in the process of scrubbing the internet clean for our eyes to see.
                                Outside of the larger conversations about outsourcing and content moderation, what this article got me curious about was the role developers have in this process. By creating technologies that require a human workforce to do either traumatic, or menial tasks, are we a part of the problem? What tactics or strategies should we be employing to change the story? Is AI the solution?
                                These questions brought me to more research on other ways we use a human workforce to do the work many assume technology is doing, which brought me to <a href="http://associationsnow.com/2014/10/mechanical-turk-putting-humans-behind-machines/">Mechanical Turk</a>. Although Mechanical Turk is not focused on content moderation, it is another workforce that asks it's laborors to use it's Human Intelligence, to complete menial tasks, that collectively contribute to major projects submitted to the site.</p>
                                In the same vein, it made me wonder what effect it had on the people working with it, and what kinds of tasks people were asked to do, that couldn't be done by complex technologies itself.
                                What I found was that workers in this space are also being paid astronomically small ammounts to do work, where there's not even a guaranteed payment. What was most fascinating was getting a glimpse into the types of processes we still require human intelligence for, instead of artificial intelligence. But if a technology required that level of "by-hand" improvement or modification to it, how sustainable can that technology be?</p>
                                <p>Being a creator, and not just a consumer, of technology affords you many magical powers, but also a lot of responsibility, to consider how the creations you build help make society better, or enable society to be the worst it can be. It's my hope that if confronted with the realization that what I'm contributing to will adversely affect society, that I have the strength and voice to <i>Git'up, Stand up! Stand up for your rights!</i></p>
                                <h3>UPDATE: Here's a great example of a young developer, who created a program called ReThink, that battles cyberbullying by stopping a young person before posting potentially harmful content and asks them to ReThink their decisions. Did i mention this is a 13 year old girl programmer?? <a href="http://www.edudemic.com/app-put-an-end-to-cyberbullying/">Read more about it!</a> </h3>
