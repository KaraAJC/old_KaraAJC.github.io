                              <h3>Conflicts come and go, the important thing is knowing how to deal with them, and come out the other side in a better place. Let's take a look at a recent example of a conflict, and how I dealt with it. </h3>

                              <p>
                                <h4>Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?</h4>
                                <p>In our attempt to learn how to write feedback that is Actionable Specific and Kind, our cohort has been required to write feedback, and rate feedback from others. One of my cohortmates reminded our cohort that it is necesarry for us to improve on our feedback, and to think more in-depth about our comments being Actionable, making sure we're not just being "nice" to our pairs. I responded to the post my cohortmate made with no response. a week later, another post along the same lines come up, and again, I respond, requesting suggestions for our cohortmates struggling to make ASK-quality feedback. Again, there was no response, and my frustration heightened at the lack of feeling heard. </p>
                                <h4>What was the source of the conflict?</h4>
                                <p>I believe that the lack of response was the source of the conflict, which inflated the feeling like other opinions were not being valued. In addition, I felt stereotype reared it's ugly head, making me feel like this silence on my response was based on being a "nagging woman"</p>
                                <h4>How did you handle that conflict?</h4>
                                <p>Upon reviewing the concept of "compass of shame" I believe this conflict had made me feel withdrawn from the cohort online group. I also discussed my feelings with other cohortmates, to confirm whether my feelings were isolated, or that others were feeling the same way. </p>
                                <h4>Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</h4>
                                <p>I think by withdrawing, my actions made the conflict worse. I think it's important to be assertive, and to be able to express emotions that arise and be able to reach an understanding on each person's impact of their words and actions.</p>
                                <h4>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</h4>
                                <p>I think what I would do differently is to reach out at the first sign of uneasiness to resolve that tension, instead of letting it grow out of control. I could also encourage others to add their thoughts to the discussion. </p>
                                <h4>What did you learn from this experience?</h4>
                                <p>After learning a little more about the compass of shame, I know that the healthy and productive option for dealing with conflict cannot be to retreat, or withdraw from the situation. I also learned that there's a point where not engaging in a discussion is needed. Last, It's important to remember that people many times don't fully forsee the impact of their actions or words, regardless of intention.</p>
