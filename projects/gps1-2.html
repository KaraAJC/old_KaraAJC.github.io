      <h3>What is Pair Programming?</h3>
      <p>Pair programming is the process of programming alongside another person, which we call Pairing.
      It is heavily used by Developers, especially at Dev Bootcamp. To pair with someone, you:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Check-in</li>
        <li>Discuss your workflow style</li>
        <li>Decide who will Drive and who will Navigate first</li>
        <li>Switch roles</li>
        <li>Give Feedback</li>
        <li>*FISTBUMP* at your success!</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h3>
      <p>Pair programming, or "pairing", is important for various reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pairing with another person gives you another set of eyes on your code, aleviating you from
          having many errors pop-up from having tunnel vision as you write your code.
        </li>
        <li>Pairing allows for different perspectives that help you contribute a broad set
        of knowledge to your code.</li>
        <li>When you pair with another programmer, having the opoprtunity to discuss your code
        can build understanding about your coding style, and help move you forward when you get stuck</li>
        <li>Working in teams is fun, and useful! Having a culture that promotes pair programming
        also breaks the "lone coder in the corner" stereotype many people have about developers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Driving and Navigating, what's that?</h3>
      <p>Driving and Navigating are the two roles you use when pairing.</p>
      <p>The driver's role is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To type the code out</li>
          <li>To keep an eye on the syntax</li>
          <li>To push the programming process forward</li>
        </ul>
      <p>The navigator's role is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To Keep an eye on the flow of the programming, and where the pair is going</li>
          <li>To research and relay the information to the driver</li>
          <li>To keep a step back from the code, and see how the code is working</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>So what is it like??</h3>
        <p>Coming from my own perspective, I really enjoy pair programming. I was someone who had the stereotype of the "lone coder" and coming to know that it's not the way DBC programs, it got me excited to be in an environment where I'm almost always going to be working in teams, meeting new people, and sharing ideas. </p>
        <p>My first pairing session, I was nervous, because I wasn't sure if I was going to do it correctly, but having a check-in as the first step definitely calmed my fears, and made me comfortable with my pair, to know where they were coming from.</p>
        <p>Pair programming is not without it's bumps, sometimes you want to correct the driver's code, or sometimes, you steer off course from what the navigator is saying, but I think it really helps with learning communication skills and team building that is invaluable when solving problems, which is what programming is all about.</p>
